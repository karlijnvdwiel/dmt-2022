<h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there! My name is <b>Demi Kraakman</b> and I'm 22 years old. I used to live in a small town close to Alkmaar but I recently moved to Leiden to study my master at Leiden University.</p>
    <p>Before doing this master, I did my bachelor <i>English Language and Culture</i> at <a href="https://uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a>.</p>
    <p >In my free time, I'm usually either reading or writing, or procastinating doing either of those things by accidentally going down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com"> TikTok</a>. If I'm not inside entertaining myself with those things, I'm usually taking long walks with my adorable dog Luna.</p>

    <p>Since I mentioned reading, I figured I'll include a list of books I've recently read:
    <ul>
        <li>None Shall Sleep - Ellie Marney</li>
        <li>Hani and Ishu's Guide to Fake Dating - Adiba Jaigirdar</li>
        <li>Killer Instinct - James Patterson</li>
        
    </ul>
    </p>
    

    <p><table width="100%">
        <thead><b>Where I'm At</b></thead>
        <tr><td width="20%">Prior Knowledge</td><td>Close to None-Existant</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Expectations</td><td>I'm not entirely sure what to expect but I reckon that if I take this one step at a time that it might be more doable than I thought.</td></tr>
    </table></p>
